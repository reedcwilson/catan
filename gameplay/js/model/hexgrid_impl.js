	This class represent a Hex. It's your hex, so put any methods you'll need on (ie. to tell get the resource/hex type, etc)
    
    In order to work with the hexgrid, this class needs to extend hexgrid.BasicHex (already done in the code). You'll need to implement
    a BaseVertex and a BaseEdge class (we give you stubs) and pass them in to the superconstructor (also already done in the code).
    Look at the the CatanVertex and CatanEdge class docs to see what needs to be done there.
     
    The hexgrid will be passed in an instance of this class to use as the model and will pull the constructor from the instance. 
    (The core.forceInherit sets the constructor, in case you were curious how that worked)
    
    So, basically... add functions as needed. Any you add will be for your personal use and convenience in writing the map class.
    
    To interact with hexes in relation to other hexes, put those functions in your map class

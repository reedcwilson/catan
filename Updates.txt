Modified the joinGame.html to submit the form correctly so that using random tiles, ports and numbers placement actually works
Modified the server to use "location" instead of "robberSpot" in the PlaceRobber API endpoint to make it consistent with the Soldier endpoint
Fixed the MapView.js to get rid of an assert that it had been throwing
Removed images from the partial zip to make it smaller. 
Fixed the server-api file included in the zip for the Maritime trade command

Updated all the files to have a '//DO NOT EDIT THIS' comment at the top of the file
Updated the server to cap the number of log lines and chat messages it stores on a per game basis
Added this file.
Removed the "lastRobber" attribute from the model JSON to bring it into conformity with the official rules.
Added the attribute "version" to the model. It specifies how many commands have been run on it. It's used to track newness.
Added the option to append ?version=x to the end of the /game/model to get the model iff the model is newer. Grab x from the model.version attribute.

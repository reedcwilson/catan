Updated all the files to have a '//DO NOT EDIT THIS' comment at the top of the file
Updated the server to cap the number of log lines and chat messages it stores on a per game basis
Added this file.
Removed the "lastRobber" attribute from the model JSON to bring it into conformity with the official rules.
Added the attribute "version" to the model. It specifies how many commands have been run on it. It's used to track newness.
Added the option to append ?version=x to the end of the /game/model to get the model iff the model is newer. Grab x from the model.version attribute.
